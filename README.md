# Customer-Churn-Prediction-with-ML
Various machine learning models are trained on a dataset from US bank to predict how  likely they are to churn, or leave the bank. The models are trained with different feature engineering and data processing techniques to increase accuracy. A web app is built to retrieve the model's predictions given customer data, providing a dashboard for visualization of these outcomes. The dashboard uses the Llama 3.1 LLM to explain the model's predictions and generate a personalized email for the customer to convince them not to churn.
